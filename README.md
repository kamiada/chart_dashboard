# Project dashboards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This project was build with React.JS and Chart.JS in order to practice.
I found this articles quite useful for learning about how Chart.JS works with React -

Possibilities for working with this data:

- difference between England and Scotland in space of last few months, with focus on number of deaths and cases
- in which months there was more cases?
- if I will find more APIs with covid data - comparison of different countries in chosen number of months

Data taken from lovely places like:
