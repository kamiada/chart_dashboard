# Project dashboards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This project was build with React.JS and Chart.JS in order to practice.
I found this articles quite useful for learning about how Chart.JS works with React -

https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-use-chartjs-to-create-charts-in-react

BUT! 

Due to the fact that I am perfectionist and like to have things done properly, after I discovered data under this link - https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide - I needed to write filters for it, and at this very stage (3rd of February anno domini 2021) - I am still playing around with this filters, and somehow from work which was focused on making pretty graphs this become project with focus on developing well working filters. 

Well done me.
